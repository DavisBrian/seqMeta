\title{Prepare scores for region based (meta) analysis}
\usage{
prepScores2(Z, formula, family = "gaussian", SNPInfo = NULL,
  snpNames = "Name", aggregateBy = "gene", kins = NULL, sparse = TRUE,
  data = parent.frame(), male = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A genotype matrix (dosage matrix) - rows correspond to individuals 
and columns correspond to SNPs. Use 'NA' for missing values. The column 
names of this matrix should correspond to SNP names in the SNP information 
file.}

\item{formula}{Base formula, of the kind used in glm() - typically of the 
form y~covariate1 + covariate2. For Cox models, the formula follows that of
the coxph() function.}

\item{family}{either 'gaussian', for continuous data, 'binomial' for 0/1 
outcomes or 'cox' for survival models.  Family data not currently supported
for binomial or survival outcomes. Male also not supported for survival
outcomes. See Details.}

\item{SNPInfo}{SNP Info file - must contain fields given in 'snpName' and 
'aggregateBy'.}

\item{snpNames}{The field of SNPInfo where the SNP identifiers are found. 
Default is 'Name'.  See Details.}

\item{aggregateBy}{The field of SNPInfo on which the skat results were 
aggregated. Default is 'gene'. For single snps which are intended only for 
single variant analyses, it is recomended that they have a unique 
identifier in this field.}

\item{kins}{the kinship matrix for related individuals. Only supported for 
family=gaussian(). See lmekin in the kinship2 package for more details.}

\item{sparse}{whether or not to use a sparse Matrix approximation for dense 
kinship matrices (defaults to TRUE).}

\item{data}{data frame in which to find variables in the formula}

\item{male}{For analyzing the X chromosome, with prepScoresX, `male' is the
gender (0/1 or F/T) indicating female/male. See details.}

\item{verbose}{logical. whether or not to print the progress bar.}
}
\value{
an object of class 'seqMeta'. This is a list, not meant for human 
  consumption, but to be fed to \code{skatMeta()} or another function. The 
  names of the list correspond to gene names. Each element in the list 
  contains
  
  \item{scores}{The scores (y-yhat)^t g} 
  \item{cov}{The variance of the scores. When no covariates are used, this is
  the LD matrix.}
  \item{n}{The number of subjects} 
  \item{maf}{The alternate allele frequency}
  \item{sey}{The residual standard error.}
}
\description{
This function is a replacement for prepScores, prepScoresX and
  prepCox. It computes and organizes the neccesary output to efficiently
  meta-analyze SKAT and other tests. Note that the tests are *not* computed
  by these functions. The output must be passed to one of 
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{skatMeta}}, \code{\link[seqMeta]{burdenMeta}}, or 
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{singlesnpMeta}}.
  
  Unlike the SKAT package which operates on one gene at a time, these 
  functions are intended to operate on many genes, e.g. a whole exome, to 
  facilitate meta analysis of whole genomes or exomes.

\details{
This function is a drop in replacement for prepScores, prepScoresX, 
  and prepCox. If family is 'cox' then the call is equivalent to prepCox and 
  an error will occur if either male or kins is provided.  When family is
  'gaussian' or 'binomial' and male is not provided then the call is
  equivalent to prepScores.  Whereas if male is provided then the call is
  equivalent to prepScoresX.
  
  This function computes the neccesary information to meta analyze SKAT 
  analyses: the individual SNP scores, their MAF, and a covariance matrix for
  each unit of aggregation. Note that the SKAT test is *not* calculated by 
  this function. The output must be passed to one of 
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{skatMeta}}, \code{\link[seqMeta]{burdenMeta}}, or 
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{singlesnpMeta}}.
  
  A crucial component of SKAT and other region-based tests is a common unit 
  of aggregation accross studies. This is given in the SNP information file 
  (argument \code{SNPInfo}), which pairs SNPs to a unit of aggregation 
  (typically a gene). The additional arguments \code{snpNames} and 
  \code{aggregateBy} specify the columns of the SNP information file which 
  contain these pairings. Note that the column names of the genotype matrix 
  \code{Z} must match the names given in the \code{snpNames} field.
  
  Using \code{prepScores2}, users are strongly recommended to use all SNPs, 
  even if they are monomorphic in your study. This is for two reasons; 
  firstly, monomorphic SNPs provide information about MAF across all studies;
  without providing the information we are unable to tell if a missing SNP 
  data was monomorphic in a study, or simply failed to genotype adequately in
  that study. Second, even if some SNPs will be filtered out of a particular 
  meta-analysis (e.g., because they are intronic or common) constructing 
  seqMeta objects describing all SNPs will reduce the workload for subsequent
  follow-up analyses.
  
  Note: to view results for a single study, one can pass a single seqMeta 
  object to a function for meta-analysis.
}
\note{
For survival models, the signed likelihood ratio statistic is used 
  instead of the score, as the score test is anti-conservative for 
  proportional hazards regression. The code for this routine is based on the 
  \code{coxph.fit} function from the \code{survival} package.
  
  Please see the package vignette for more details.
