\usage{
prepCox(Z, formula, SNPInfo = NULL, snpNames = "Name",
  aggregateBy = "gene", data = parent.frame(), verbose = FALSE)

prepScores(Z, formula, family = stats::gaussian(), SNPInfo = NULL,
  snpNames = "Name", aggregateBy = "gene", kins = NULL, sparse = TRUE,
  data = parent.frame(), verbose = FALSE)

  snpNames = "Name", aggregateBy = "gene", kins = NULL, sparse = TRUE,
  data = parent.frame(), verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{A genotype matrix (dosage matrix) - rows correspond to individuals
and columns correspond to SNPs. Use 'NA' for missing values. The column
names of this matrix should correspond to SNP names in the SNP information
file.}

\item{formula}{Base formula, of the kind used in glm() - typically of the
form y~covariate1 + covariate2. For Cox models, the formula follows that of
the coxph() function.}

\item{SNPInfo}{SNP Info file - must contain fields given in 'snpName' and
'aggregateBy'.}

\item{snpNames}{The field of SNPInfo where the SNP identifiers are found.
Default is 'Name'.  See Details.}

\item{aggregateBy}{The field of SNPInfo on which the skat results were
aggregated. Default is 'gene'. For single snps which are intended only for
single variant analyses, it is recomended that they have a unique
identifier in this field.}

\item{data}{data frame in which to find variables in the formula}

\item{verbose}{logical. whether or not to print the progress bar.}

\item{family}{either gaussian(), for continuous data, or binomial() for 0/1
outcomes. Binary outcomes are not currently supported for family data.}

\item{kins}{the kinship matrix for related individuals. Only supported for
family=gaussian(). See lmekin in the kinship2 package for more details.}

\item{sparse}{whether or not to use a sparse Matrix approximation for dense
kinship matrices (defaults to TRUE).}

\item{male}{For analyzing the X chromosome, with prepScoresX, `male' is the
gender (0/1 or F/T) indicating female/male. See details.}
}
\value{
an object of class 'seqMeta'. This is a list, not meant for human
  consumption, but to be fed to \code{skatMeta()} or another function. The
  names of the list correspond to gene names. Each element in the list
  contains

  \item{scores}{The scores (y-yhat)^t g}
  \item{cov}{The variance of the scores. When no covariates are used, this is the LD matrix.}
  \item{n}{The number of subjects}
  \item{maf}{The minor allele frequency}
  \item{sey}{The residual standard error.}

\description{
This function computes and organizes the neccesary output to
  efficiently meta-analyze SKAT and other tests. Note that the tests are
  *not* computed by these functions. The output must be passed to one of
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{skatMeta}}, \code{\link[seqMeta]{burdenMeta}}, or
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{singlesnpMeta}}.

  Unlike the SKAT package which operates on one gene at a time, these
  functions are intended to operate on many genes, e.g. a whole exome, to
  facilitate meta analysis of whole genomes or exomes.
}
\details{
This function computes the neccesary information to meta analyze
  SKAT analyses: the individual SNP scores, their MAF, and a covariance
  matrix for each unit of aggregation. Note that the SKAT test is *not*
  calculated by this function. The output must be passed to one of
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{skatMeta}}, \code{\link[seqMeta]{burdenMeta}}, or
  \code{\link[seqMeta]{singlesnpMeta}}.

  A crucial component of SKAT and other region-based tests is a common unit
  of aggregation accross studies. This is given in the SNP information file
  (argument \code{SNPInfo}), which pairs SNPs to a unit of aggregation
  (typically a gene). The additional arguments \code{snpNames} and
  \code{aggregateBy} specify the columns of the SNP information file which
  contain these pairings. Note that the column names of the genotype matrix
  \code{Z} must match the names given in the \code{snpNames} field.

  Using \code{prepScores}, users are strongly recommended to use all SNPs,
  even if they are monomorphic in your study. This is for two reasons;
  firstly, monomorphic SNPs provide information about MAF across all studies;
  without providing the information we are unable to tell if a missing SNP
  data was monomorphic in a study, or simply failed to genotype adequately in
  that study. Second, even if some SNPs will be filtered out of a particular
  meta-analysis (e.g., because they are intronic or common) constructing
  seqMeta objects describing all SNPs will reduce the workload for subsequent
  follow-up analyses.

  Note: to view results for a single study, one can pass a single seqMeta
  object to a function for meta-analysis.
}
\note{
For \code{prepCox}, the signed likelihood ratio statistic is used
  instead of the score, as the score test is anti-conservative for
  proportional hazards regression. The code for this routine is based on the
  \code{coxph.fit} function from the \code{survival} package.

  Please see the package vignette for more details.
