\usage{
skatOMeta(..., SNPInfo = NULL, skat.wts = function(maf) {    
  stats::dbeta(maf, 1, 25) }, burden.wts = function(maf) {     as.numeric(maf

}
\arguments{
\item{...}{\code{seqMeta} objects}

\item{SNPInfo}{The SNP Info file.  This should contain the fields listed in
snpNames and aggregateBy. Only SNPs in this table will be meta analyzed, so
this may be used to restrict the analysis.}

\item{skat.wts}{Either a function to calculate testing weights for SKAT, or a
character specifying a vector of weights in the SNPInfo file. For skatOMeta
the default are the `beta' weights.}

\item{burden.wts}{Either a function to calculate weights for the burden test,
or a character specifying a vector of weights in the SNPInfo file. For
skatOMeta the default are the T1 weights.}

\item{rho}{A sequence of values that specify combinations of SKAT and a burden test to be considered. Default is c(0,1), which considers SKAT and a burden test.}

\item{method}{p-value calculation method. Should be one of 'saddlepoint', 'integration', or 'liu'.}

\item{snpNames}{The field of SNPInfo where the SNP identifiers are found.
Default is 'Name'}

\item{aggregateBy}{The field of SNPInfo on which the skat results were
aggregated.  Default is 'gene'. Though gene groupings are not explicitely
required for single snp analysis, it is required to find where single snp
information is stored in the seqMeta objects.}

\item{mafRange}{Range of MAF's to include in the analysis (endpoints included).  Default is all SNPs (0 <= MAF <= 0.5).}

\item{verbose}{logical. Whether progress bars should be printed.}
}
\value{
a data frame with the following columns:
  \item{gene}{Name of the gene or unit of aggregation being meta analyzed}
  \item{p}{p-value of the SKAT-O test.}
  \item{pmin}{The minimum of the p-values considered by SKAT-O (not corrected for multiple testing!).}
  \item{rho}{The value of rho which gave the smallest p-value.}
  \item{cmaf}{The cumulative minor allele frequency.}
  \item{nmiss}{The number of `missing` SNPs. For a gene with a single SNP
  this is the number of individuals which do not contribute to the analysis,
  due to studies that did not report results for that SNP. For a gene with
  multiple SNPs, is totalled over the gene. }
  \item{nsnps}{The number of SNPs in the gene.}
  \item{errflag}{An indicator of possible error: 0 suggests no error, > 0
  indicates probable loss of accuracy.}

\description{
Takes as input `seqMeta` objects (from e.g.
  \code{\link{prepScores}}), and meta analyzes them, using SKAT-O. See the
  package vignette for more extensive documentation.
}
\details{
\code{skatOMeta()} implements the SKAT-Optimal test, which picks the
  `best' combination of SKAT and a burden test, and then corrects for the
  flexibility afforded by this choice. Specifically, if the SKAT statistic is
  Q1, and the squared score for a burden test is Q2, SKAT-O considers tests
  of the form (1-rho)*Q1 + rho*Q2, where rho between 0 and 1. The values of
  rho are specified by the user using the argument \code{rho}. In the
  simplest form, which is the default, SKAT-O computes a SKAT test and a T1
  test, and reports the minimum p-value, corrected for multiple testing. See
  the vignette or the accompanying references for more details.

  If there is a single variant in the gene, or the burden test is undefined
  (e.g. there are no rare alleles for the T1 test), SKAT is reported (i.e.
  rho=0).

  Note 1: the SKAT package uses the same weights for both SKAT and the burden
  test, which this function does not.

  Note 2: all studies must use coordinated SNP Info files - that is, the SNP
  names and gene definitions must be the same.

  Note 3: The method of p-value calculation is much more important here than
  in SKAT.  The `integration' method is fast and typically accurate for
  p-values larger than 1e-9. The saddlepoint method is slower, but has higher
  relative accuracy.

  Note 4: Since p-value calculation can be slow for SKAT-O, and less accurate
  for small p-values, a reasonable alternative would be to first calculate
  SKAT and a burden test, and record the minimum p-value, which is a lower
  bound for the SKAT-O p-value. This can be done quickly and accurately.
  Then, one would only need to perform SKAT-O on the small subset of genes
  that are potentially interesting.

  Please see the package vignette for more details.

### load example data for 2 studies
data(seqMetaExample)

####run on each study:
cohort1 <- prepScores(Z=Z1, y~sex+bmi, SNPInfo = SNPInfo, data =pheno1)
cohort2 <- prepScores(Z=Z2, y~sex+bmi, SNPInfo = SNPInfo, kins=kins, data=pheno2)

#### combine results:
##skat-O with default settings:
out1 <- skatOMeta(cohort1, cohort2, SNPInfo = SNPInfo, method = "int")
head(out1)

##skat-O, using a large number of combinations between SKAT and T1 tests:
out2 <- skatOMeta(cohort1, cohort2, rho=seq(0,1,length=11), SNPInfo=SNPInfo, method="int")
head(out2)

#rho = 0 indicates SKAT gave the smaller p-value (or the T1 is undefined)
#rho=1 indicates the burden test was chosen
# 0 < rho < 1 indicates some other value was chosen
#notice that most of the time either the SKAT or T1 is chosen
table(out2$rho)

##skat-O with beta-weights used in the burden test:
out3 <- skatOMeta(cohort1,cohort2, burden.wts = function(maf){dbeta(maf,1,25) },
                  rho=seq(0,1,length=11),SNPInfo = SNPInfo, method="int")
