For general questions, please ask them on StackOverflow first, using the `r` tag: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask Please come back here only if nobody answers your question there, and let me know the URL of your StackOverflow post. If you are not sure whether to post a StackOverflow question or open a Github issue, do the former first.

For bug reports, please provide a minimal, self-contained, and reproducible example by reducing your example as much as possible right before the problem goes away.  For a good introduction on how to make a helpful minimal reproducible example see [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example), or [this helpful post by Hadley]( https://gist.github.com/hadley/270442) or [this RStudio post](https://community.rstudio.com/t/faq-whats-a-reproducible-example-reprex-and-how-do-i-do-one/5219) or [this blog post]( https://www.r-bloggers.com/minimal-reproducible-examples/) By doing this, you may be able to figure out what the problem really is before reporting to me. You can attach your example as a zip file here. You may consider creating your reproducible example based on the built in seqMeta data sets.  Please include your session info with `devtools::session_info()` and the structure (`str()`) of your phenotype, genotype, and snpinfo dataset.

Usually your issue will be closed after it is fixed, but sometimes it is closed only because we are not able to offer any help. It does not mean your issue is not real or bad. You can propose a fix by yourself through a pull request. Your constructive feedback is always appreciated.
